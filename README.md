# Introduction
ðŸ”¥ Dive into the data job market! Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets high salary in data analytics. ðŸ“Š

# Background
### ðŸ’­ The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs? 
2. What skills are required for these top-paying
jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data
analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher
salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

### ðŸ“Š Database Tables
![Tables](image.png)

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to
query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
ðŸ”Ž Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.

### 1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
<u>Code:<u>

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
    
FROM
    job_postings_fact

 -- only want rows whose companies have job postings
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id

WHERE
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'

ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC

LIMIT 10
```
<u>Output:<u>

# What I have learnt
- Basic and advanced SQL queries. (E.g. CASE, CTEs, Sub-Queries etc.)
- How to document my project in markdown format.
- Understand and pushing my SQL project to Github using shell scripting.
- Most of all, troubleshooting my careless mistakes...

# Conclusions
This project enhanced my SQL skills and provided valuable insights into the data analyst job market. The findings from the analysis serve as a guide to prioritising skill development and job search efforts. Aspiring data analysts like myself, can better position themselves in a competitive job market by focusing on high-demand, high-salary skills. This exploration highlights the importance of continuous learning and adaptation to emerging trends in the field of data analytics.
